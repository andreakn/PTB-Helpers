Some nice tools to help you work with Joal Abrahamssons PageTypeBuilder for EPiServer CMS.
CreatePTBClasses: Creates .cs-files for page types in an existing project not using PageTypeBuilder.
MatchPTBProperties: Helps you to keep your page types up2date if you change/remove properties from code.

Will probably add some code snippets for PTB in a few days.
